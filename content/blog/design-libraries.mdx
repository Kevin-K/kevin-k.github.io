## When design meets engineering 

I view **core design elements** not always as the smallest reusable essence (think atoms). To me core design elements
are ideally  small in purpose, and are building blocks for more complex elements in an end product (think molecules).

Code is a living thing just like designs, and as it matures **composite design elements** emerge that, while reused less 
frequently, propel development forward when a new feature can be built leveraging larger aspects of existing code.

Elements of a design are a blend of style and functionality. For a low-resolution idea on what those element "sizes" are to me:
* **core elements** - a table, a list, a button, a form, a modal
* **composite elements** - an infinite loading table, a CRUD table, a selection modal comprising of a list of choices

Each product is different, and there are plenty of pre-built design libraries that propel greenfield efforts forward.
Take [material design's react library](https://material-ui.com/) for example, an excellent collection of core design elements
ready to go.

## The field isn't always greener
I've provoked this thought on what to consider a core design element not to bait and switch into "use what's out there!",
rather to take on the challenge of legacy code.

Envision starting a new job, being brought in to modernize a legacy application, and you pull down the existing codebase.
At the end of a pot of coffee, you find yourself lost in implementation details. There's conflicting implementations of inputs in style and code, 
multiple components serve the same purpose less "a small detail", styling definitions are spread wide and overlap.

Naive thoughts of "rewrite this and that!" run through your mind, and that's normal. You've picked up a project that has history, you want to get
functionality built to meet deadlines, and you want to do your best to leave the code better than you found it. Time is valuable, and rewriting
can be expensive when new functionality also needs to be delivered.

Hit rewind on those thoughts, search and replace "rewrite" with "consolidate". Does that change any of the cost? Every scenario is different,
there  is no silver bullet, but I've found more often than not that consolidating duplications in design has set designers and developers up for 
success. 

## An exercise: tables
Look at tables in your product. Have many of them? Great. Do they serve different functional purposes? Ok. Are there subtle differences in
the aspects which interact with the tables (buttons, scrollability, ect)? Perfect. If this doesn't apply to your product, perhaps this exercise
will open developer and designer eyes to unknown consistency issues.

Pick an implementation of how tabular data is represented in your product from a design mindset of which behaviorally is leveraged across
your system. Think about filterability, pagination, how rows of data are represented, and what types of data columns represent. Is there 
an implementation that is common to all usage? If so you've found a core table element for your product.

It's likely that search fails, each instance of a table has something different and there isn't one that all of which could grow from! Start redacting
from your criteria, take out the notion of what the content is (engineering hopefully has), then pagination, ect. As an extreme, you may find that
no basis can be made from a functional standpoint. If thats the case your basis for a component is the visual notion of a table. Maybe this sparks
thoughts on "well we should enhance all tables for pagination, then thats our basis". Good, hold on to that thought, document it, and come back to
it once you have your core element because you still don't have it yet. If you have multiple visual representations of tables, see if
consolidating to a single style is possible, if not capture your variants.

Design takes their findings to engineering, the core element is "just a table" design exclaims. Our system has a "default" table look and a "small" variant.
Engineering does some code searching, and finds they do have implementations of a "just table", one in plain html with the table tag,
another leveraging div's with bootstrap columns, another with CSS flexbox. Peeling back the implementations, they have subtle styling differences. A few
pixel difference in margins, how text is handled on various browser sizes, and how to apply variants. One engineer rushes to point out, how engineers
instantiate these tables is different too! Look at how we adapt our API responses to fill those tables.

Design has proposed what the base "just a table" should look like, and assures engineering if we represent tables this way, we can enhance our designs
moving forward. Engineering now faces consolidating existing implementations down to one base. That base realistically doesn't exist since there were 
subtle differences in mockups to engineering implementation. Engineering pushes forward updating one of the table implementations, the one best fit to 
build off of moving forward, to make the design mock. 

During this push engineering thinks critically to make that table a building block. Knowing that design wants to make pagination a widely used (but not everywhere)
aspect of the product, engineers huddle around how to best encapsulate the design element in code form. Be it through composition or inheritance driven engineering,
the engineers have agreed on an interface into the table which promotes expanded use moving forward without overloading the base table.

Engineering updates implementations to leverage that base table, adapting into existing extra functionality as needed, and updates the tests.
Ideally there's a net loss on the lines of code, but importantly there's a net gain on confidence in using tables in the product. Testing becomes more confident,
and adding additional tables to the system now has an agreed upon approach. Design and engineering alike can move quickly through the agreed upon notion of a 
table.

The **core element: Table** is indoctrinated into the products design library. Tooling may be leveraged to retain that living **contract between design and engineering**,
a common example is the usage of [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## 1 week later

What happens when new feature requests flow in, "give that table buttons, filterability, pivotability, and a fresh paint job!"? Each team operates differently,
what process they use likely dictates how/when those discussions occur. My mindset is think critically, be adaptable, but also be true to 
your product's core design. 

Adding buttons into the table may seem like a fast win, and may ship that feature 
early, but what does that do for functionality added 1, 6, 12 months down the line? There are always judgement calls to be made, there is no 
silver bullet. Think critically to set the future you up for success. Adding those buttons to the table may work fine, but not all tables need buttons
in your system, would a composite element encapsulating  tabular data and buttons work as well? Perhaps think of making a **composite element: ActionableTable**.

Products are not built and maintained in sprints (the running kind not the agile kind), but they are marathons. Thinking critically as 
the product grows and adapting code may slow you down at times, but don't view that as time lost, view it as time invested for future momentum.

There are no silver bullets, time-critical updates will be had and design and code will drift from being
"true to its core". Be critical and make changes where it makes sense, if consolidating two conflicting elements seems risky and too costly,
document it and revisit it when the cost reduces and the runway is longer. At the end of the day, do your best to leave your product in a 
better state than how you found it.
