## How my [resume](/resume) was created 

I've used a great tool for the last few years to manage my resume,
[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/). If you are looking for a 
tool to quickly structure a resume it's worth a look. Given some JSON and 
a selected theme, you can quickly export a resume to PDF or HTML.

I was in the process of building this website to host my resume and hobby 
projects and decided to take my resume and recreated it in React. The reason? 
This website is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which gives you 
the ability to pulling static content into a page through GraphQL.

## Desired Output

1. The resume renders in a "print" format on desktop.
2. The resume renders in a readable format on mobile.
3. The resume can be printed from the browser (and saved to PDF).

## The Approach
I had at one point in time forked the [onepage theme](https://github.com/Kevin-K/jsonresume-theme-onepage)
from JSON Resume for some minor style tweaks, so I thankfully had an existing
product to work from.

<figure>
<img src={old_resume_snippet} style={{display: 'block', width: 400, margin: 'auto'}}/>
<figcaption style={{textAlign: 'center'}}> <i>An excerpt of my old JSON Resume</i> </figcaption>
</figure>

I find often when working against a mockup it helps to carve out your React componentry 
with a top-down approach. Reusable code can be found through itterating through a design
from the top-down, so to begin I envisioned creating a monolithic resume component.

---

### Itteration 1: 1 Component to Rule them all

<figure>
<img src={old_resume_snippet_monolithic} style={{display: 'block', width: 400, margin: 'auto'}}/>
<figcaption style={{textAlign: 'center'}}> <i>A monolithic Resume component</i> </figcaption>
</figure>

### Pros
- One file.
- Migration of HTML/CSS from existing JSON Resume would be fast

### Cons
- Low reusability
- High code complexity

The pros here are file simplicity, I could toss everything in one file and call it a day,
should I need to revisit the resume in the future all I'll need to do is open my `resume.js`
file and modify my component.

The number of properties applied onto the resume component will be high. That is
not of great concern to me, as I view this component as serving a single purpose.


```js
<Resume
    name="Kevin Kelly"
    title="Senior Software Engineer"
    email="kevin@kevinjkelly.net"
    phone="(555) 555-5555"
    summary="Kevin is an experienced software engineer with  ..."
    experience={[
        {
            company: "StealthPath, Inc",
            title: "Senior Software Engineer",
            startDate: "2017-07-01",
            endDate: "present"
            achievements: [
                "Team lead and lead front-end developer for ...",
                "Managed and mentored web development efforts ...",
                //...
            ]

        }
    ]}
    volunteer={[/*...*/]}
    education={[/*...*/]}
    skills={[/*...*/]}
    />
```


This lacks code reusability. If I want to create a modified resume layout my options
are to either:

1. Copy and paste the Resume component code. **Bad: Duplicated logic**
2. Add the modified layout to the Resume component and add a prop to select the
modified layout. **Bad: God component**

It's not evident yet, but there's an abundance of functionality within this
one component. At this point in the design itteration I give my code the
"test smell-test"

---

### Itteration 2: Now with Smell-O-Vision

#### Test Smell-Test
*How painful is testing this going to be?*

Break down what you would test in your component. If this list is long, try and find some
commonalities of your tests. This may shed some light on a reusable component to
break out.

1. Name is rendered.
2. Title is rendered.
3. Address is rendered.
4. Email is rendered.
5. Phone number is rendered.
6. "SUMMARY" category title is rendered.
6. Summary content is rendered.
7. "EXPERIENCE" category title is rendered.
8. Each job: company is rendered.
9. Each job: title is rendered.
10. Each job: timeframe is rendered.
11. Each job: each achievement is rendered.
12. "VOLUNTEER" category title is rendered.
13. Each volunteer: company is rendered.
14. Each volunteer: title is rendered.
15. Each volunteer: timeframe is rendered.
16. Each volunteer: each achievement is rendered.
17. "EDUCATION" category title is rendered.
18. Each education: school is rendered.
19. Each education: degree is rendered.
20. Each education: timeframe is rendered.
21. Each education: GPA is rendered.
22. "SKILLS" category title is rendered.
23. Each skill: skill group is rendered.
24. Each skill group: individual skills are rendered.

Reading through my test cases, I see a pattern arise between each section
of the resume below the header:

1. A category title is rendered.
2. Some content is rendered.

I could potentially break my Resume component down to use a Content component.
This would reduce the duplication of logic within my Resume that would be applied to 
each content section.

/// put mockup here for with content component.


#### Content commenalities
I could go further to say within the content there are additional coorelations,
like how the "EXPERIENCE" section and "VOLUNTEER" section have matching
test criterias and the style of each content section is identical.

Looks like I can use a single component to handle both sections. Out of fear
of pre-mature optimization, I'm going to create a component for each 
content section, but let the "VOLUNTEER" section compoent call the "WORK" 
section component.

/// put mockup here with work and volunteer components

The "EDUCATION" section seems to closely match "EXPERIENCE" as well.
I see that my resume's education section includes a school, thats like a 
company (in data labeling form, I'm not knocking our education system), but
the GPA render doesn't coorelate to the achievement render.
The "EXPERIENCE" achievements are a list for each job, but I have only
one GPA for each "EDUCATION" degree. Slightly lost? Me too. This looks
like **pre-mature optimizaiton**. When I hit a point where
a extraction isn't crystal clear I back off. It looks like "EDUCATION"
and "SKILLS" for now will be their own components.

Rome wasn't built in a day, and the cleanest code wasn't built in one
itteration. Extracting code often poses new challenges, so I 
err on the side of caution. Extract too much? You're now dealing
with component hell. Extract too little? You're not getting
"clean cuts" of your components for reusability.

---

### Itteration 3: Sweeping under the Rug

At this point I'm happy with the reduction in code duplication, by
structuring each section of my resume into `Content` blocks containing 
`Work`, `Volunteer`, `Education`, and `Skill` components, my resume
only contains a chunk of unique logic that pertains to showing my name,
title, contact details. The summary is just a text blurb, so
it can be a child of a `Content` block, no need for extra components.

Moving the heading logic into its own component isn't saving any lines
of code. If anything its adding more files to the project to manage.
For future reusability sake I want to make the heading its own component,
I may place it elsewhere on my projects as my signature, and it would be
silly to import from my resume to gain a shared lower-level component.



## End Structure
The content used as the resume asset can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kevin-K/kevin-k.github.io/815ac2295cbba8325af1adb1568fefdf84194aaa/src/assets/resume.json).
```js
import resumeData from '../assets/resume.json';
const Resume = props => (<div>
      <Heading {...resumeData.basics} />
      <Content title="SUMMARY">
        <span> {resumeData.basics.summary}</span>
      </Content>
      <Content title="EXPERIENCE">
        {resumeData.work.map(entry => (
          <Work {...entry} key={`${entry.name}-${entry.startDate}`} />
        ))}
      </Content>
      <Content title="VOLUNTEER">
        {resumeData.volunteer.map(entry => (
          <Volunteer {...entry} key={`${entry.name}-${entry.startDate}`} />
        ))}
      </Content>
      <Content title="EDUCATION">
        {resumeData.education.map(entry => (
          <Education {...entry} key={`${entry.name}-${entry.startDate}`} />
        ))}
      </Content>
      <Content title="SKILLS">
        {resumeData.skills.map(entry => (
          <Skill {...entry} key={`${entry.name}-${entry.level}`} />
        ))}
      </Content>
    </div>);
```
