title: Building a Resume with React
description: My journey through component design iteration
---
import theme from '../../src/themes';
const EXAMPLE_STYLE = {border: `5px solid ${theme.palette.primary.main}`, padding: '20px'};
import old_resume_snippet from '../../src/assets/old_resume_snippet.jpg';
import old_resume_snippet_monolithic from '../../src/assets/old_resume_snippet_monolithic.jpg';

## How my [resume](/resume) was created 

I've used the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) tool for the last handful years to manage my resume,
its a document generator, running on the notion of a common JSON [schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) for resume content. 
If you are looking for a tool to quickly structure a resume it's worth a look. Given some JSON and 
a selected theme, you can quickly export a resume to PDF or HTML.

I was in the process of building this website to host my resume and hobby 
projects and decided to take my resume and recreated it in React. I'd like to say
there was a flashy reason to do this. Pragmatically, the resume has nothing to gain in performance
or content editability (since it's just updating a JSON file). Hobby projects are a great chance for
developers to throw needed buy-in aside and try new things "just because". 

I've had a laundry list of things in the javascript ecosystem to revisit, two of which were:
 1. publishing NPM packages
 2. leveraging component library tooling

With that, [resume-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resume-react) was created, and [storybook](https://kevin-k.github.io/resume-react/?path=/docs/full-resume-example--readme-example)
powered the living docs. Onward to a journey of how the componentry of react-resume came to be.

## Desired Output

1. The resume renders in a "print-like" format on desktop.
2. The resume renders in a readable format on mobile.
3. The resume can be printed from the browser (and saved to PDF).

This is a two part blog post. Here we will explore migrating an existing HTML resume over
to react. Part two explores print formatting considerations.

## The Approach
I had at one point in time forked the [onepage theme](https://github.com/Kevin-K/jsonresume-theme-onepage)
from JSON Resume for some minor style tweaks, so I thankfully had an existing
product to work from.

<figure>
<img src={old_resume_snippet} style={{display: 'block', width: 400, margin: 'auto'}}/>
<figcaption style={{textAlign: 'center'}}> <i>An excerpt of my old JSON Resume</i> </figcaption>
</figure>

I find often when working against a mockup it helps to carve out your React componentry 
with a top-down approach. Reusable code can be found through itterating through a design
from the top-down, so to begin I envisioned creating a monolithic resume component.

---

## Iteration 1: 1 Component to Rule them all

<figure>
<img src={old_resume_snippet_monolithic} style={{display: 'block', width: 400, margin: 'auto'}}/>
<figcaption style={{textAlign: 'center'}}> <i>A monolithic Resume component</i> </figcaption>
</figure>

### Pros
- One file.
- Migration of HTML/CSS from existing JSON Resume would be fast

### Cons
- Low reusability
- High code complexity

The pros here are file simplicity, I could copy the existing HTML into 1 react component and call it a day,
should I need to revisit the resume in the future all I'll need to do is open a **resume.js**
file and modify my component.

The number of properties applied onto the resume component will be high. That is
not of great concern to me, as I view this component as serving a single purpose.

```jsx
<Resume
  name="John Smith"
  title="Architect"
  email="john.smith@example.com" 
  phone="(555) 555-5555"
  location={{city: "New York", region: "NY"}} 
  phone="555-555-5555"
  summary="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet  ..."
  experience={[
    {
      name: "Acme Inc",
      position: "Lead Architect",
      startDate: "2002-01-10",
      endDate: "2008-08-01"
      highlights: [
        "Designed a 30 story house boat.", 
        "Scuba instructor on company retreat.",
        "Weaved many underwater baskets."
      ]

    }
  ]}
  volunteer={[/*...*/]}
  education={[/*...*/]}
  skills={[/*...*/]}
/>
```


This lacks code reusability. If I want to create a modified resume layout my options
are to either:

1. Copy and paste the Resume component code. **Bad: duplicated logic**
2. Add the modified layout to the Resume component and add a prop to select the
modified layout. **Bad: breaks [single responsibility  principle](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html)**

It's not evident yet, but there's an abundance of functionality within this
one component. Having a top-level component, Resume, sounds beneficial!
It's the interfacing layer of the JSONResume data into the presentation layer. If my goal was
to migrate my resume into a React component, I could call it a day. With reacts [composition 
ideology](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html), I have encapsulated my resume behind
a component barrier. Wherever it is rendered, other components rendered shouldn't care about it!


Rather than just pick apart what lives under the shell of Resume, I'll give my code the
"test smell-test".

---

## Iteration 2: Now with Smell-O-Vision

#### Test Smell-Test
*What could be tested?*

Break down what you could test in your component. This is awkward since code already exists, and tests
do not for the react component in this instance. If this list is long, try and find some
commonalities of your tests. This may shed some light on a reusable component to
break out.

1. Name is shown.
2. Title is shown.
3. Address is shown.
4. Email is shown.
5. Phone number is shown.
6. "SUMMARY" category title is shown.
6. Summary content is shown.
7. "EXPERIENCE" category title is shown.
8. Each job: company is shown.
9. Each job: title is shown.
10. Each job: timeframe is shown.
11. Each job: each achievement is shown.
12. "VOLUNTEER" category title is shown.
13. Each volunteer: company is shown.
14. Each volunteer: title is shown.
15. Each volunteer: timeframe is shown.
16. Each volunteer: each achievement is shown.
17. "EDUCATION" category title is shown.
18. Each education: school is shown.
19. Each education: degree is shown.
20. Each education: timeframe is shown.
21. Each education: GPA is shown.
22. "SKILLS" category title is shown.
23. Each skill: skill group is shown.
24. Each skill group: individual skills are shown.

Reading through my test cases, I see a pattern arise between each section
of the resume below the header:

1. A category title is shown.
2. Some content is shown.

I could potentially break my Resume component down to use a Content component.
This would reduce the duplication of logic within my Resume that would be applied to 
each content section.

---

### Content Component
import {Content} from 'resume-react';

<div style={EXAMPLE_STYLE}>
  <Content title="EXPERIENCE">
    <div>
      <span>Section details go here, including things like:</span>
      <ul>
        <li> organization info </li>
        <li> timeframe </li>
        <li> list of details </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </Content>
</div>

```jsx
<Content title="EXPERIENCE">
  <div>
    <span>Section details go here, including things like:</span>
    <ul>
      <li> organization info </li>
      <li> timeframe </li>
      <li> list of details </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</Content>
```

#### Content commonalities
I could go further to say within the content there are additional correlations,
like how the (work) "EXPERIENCE" section and "VOLUNTEER" section have matching
test criterias and the style of each content section is identical.

Looks like I can use a single component to handle both sections. Out of fear
of pre-mature optimization, I'm going to create a component for each 
content section, but let the "VOLUNTEER" section component call the "EXPERIENCE" 
section component. For generic purposes, I'll call that component **Work**.

---

## Work Component
import {Work} from 'resume-react';

<div style={EXAMPLE_STYLE}>
  <Work 
    name="Acme Inc" 
    position="Lead Architect" 
    startDate="2002-01-10" 
    endDate="2008-08-01" 
    url="https://example.com"
    highlights={["Designed a 30 story house boat.", "Scuba instructor on company retreat.", "Weaved many underwater baskets."]}
  />
</div>

```jsx
<Work 
  name="Acme Inc" 
  position="Lead Architect" 
  startDate="2002-01-10" 
  endDate="2008-08-01" 
  url="https://example.com"
  highlights={["Designed a 30 story house boat.", "Scuba instructor on company retreat.", "Weaved many underwater baskets."]}
/>
```

The "EDUCATION" section seems to closely match "EXPERIENCE" as well.
I see that my resume's education section includes a school, thats like a 
company (in data labeling form, I'm not knocking our education system), but
the GPA render doesn't correlate to the achievement render.
The "EXPERIENCE" achievements are a list for each job, but I have only
one GPA for each "EDUCATION" degree. Slightly lost? Me too. This looks
like **premature optimization**. When I hit a point where
an extraction isn't crystal-clear I back off. It looks like "EDUCATION"
and "SKILLS" for now will be their own components.

---

## Education Component
import {Education} from 'resume-react';

<div style={EXAMPLE_STYLE}>
  <Education 
    institution="State Tech" 
    studyType="Bachelor of Science" 
    area="Underwater Basket Weaving"
    startDate="1990-09-10" 
    endDate="1996-05-01" 
    gpa= "3.4"
  />
</div>

```jsx
<Education 
  institution="State Tech" 
  studyType="Bachelor of Science" 
  area="Underwater Basket Weaving"
  startDate="1990-09-10" 
  endDate="1996-05-01" 
  gpa= "3.4"
/>
```

---

## Skills Component
import {Skills} from 'resume-react';

<div style={EXAMPLE_STYLE}>
  <Skills 
    name="Weaving" 
    level="Master"
    keywords={["Straw","Yarn","Paper","The fabric of time and space"]}
  />
</div>

```jsx
<Skills 
  name="Weaving" 
  level="Master"
  keywords={["Straw","Yarn","Paper","The fabric of time and space"]}
/>
```

## Current State

Rome wasn't built in a day, and the cleanest code wasn't built in one
teration. Extracting code often poses new challenges, so I 
err on the side of caution. Extract too much? You're now dealing
with component hell. Extract too little? You're not getting
"clean cuts" of your components for reusability.

At this point I'm happy with the reduction in code duplication, by
structuring each section of my resume into **Content** blocks containing 
**Work**, **Volunteer**, **Education**, and **Skill** components. 

<div style={EXAMPLE_STYLE}>
  <Content title="EXPERIENCE">
    <Work 
      name="Acme Inc" 
      position="Lead Architect" 
      startDate="2002-01-10" 
      endDate="2008-08-01" 
      url="https://example.com"
      highlights={["Designed a 30 story house boat.", "Scuba instructor on company retreat.", "Weaved many underwater baskets."]}
    />
    <Work 
      name="Example LLC" 
      position="Architect" 
      startDate="2008-07-01" 
      endDate="2000-01-01" 
      url="https://example.com"
      highlights={["Made examples", "Generated stock footage", "Lorel ipsum"]}
    />
  </Content>
  <Content title="EDUCATION">
    <Education 
      institution="State Tech" 
      studyType="Bachelor of Science" 
      area="Underwater Basket Weaving"
      startDate="1990-09-10" 
      endDate="1996-05-01" 
      gpa= "3.4"
    />
  </Content>
  <Content title="SKILLS">
    <Skills 
      name="Weaving" 
      level="Master"
      keywords={["Straw","Yarn","Paper","The fabric of time and space"]}
    />
    <Skills 
      name="Design" 
      level="Intermediate"
      keywords={["CSS","Figma"]}
    />
  </Content>
</div>

```jsx
<Content title="EXPERIENCE">
  <Work 
    name="Acme Inc" 
    position="Lead Architect" 
    startDate="2002-01-10" 
    endDate="2008-08-01" 
    url="https://example.com"
    highlights={["Designed a 30 story house boat.", "Scuba instructor on company retreat.", "Weaved many underwater baskets."]}
  />
  <Work 
    name="Example LLC" 
    position="Architect" 
    startDate="2008-07-01" 
    endDate="2000-01-01" 
    url="https://example.com"
    highlights={["Made examples", "Generated stock footage", "Lorem ipsum"]}
  />
</Content>
<Content title="EDUCATION">
  <Education 
    institution="State Tech" 
    studyType="Bachelor of Science" 
    area="Underwater Basket Weaving"
    startDate="1990-09-10" 
    endDate="1996-05-01" 
    gpa="3.4"
  />
</Content>
<Content title="SKILLS">
  <Skills 
    name="Weaving" 
    level="Master"
    keywords={["Straw","Yarn","Paper","The fabric of time and space"]}
  />
  <Skills 
    name="Design" 
    level="Intermediate"
    keywords={["CSS","Figma"]}
  />
</Content>
```

What remains? My resume contains a chunk of unique logic that pertains to showing my name,
title, contact details, that may be worth componentizing. The summary is just a text blurb, so
it can use a **Content** block, no need for extra components.

---

## Heading Component

Moving the heading logic into its own component, **Heading**, isn't saving any lines
of code. If anything it's adding more files to the project to manage. 
For future reusability sake I want to make the heading its own component,
I may place it elsewhere on my projects as my signature, and it would be
silly to import from my resume to gain a shared lower-level component.

import { Heading } from "resume-react";

<div style={EXAMPLE_STYLE}>
  <Heading 
    name="John Smith" 
    title="Architect" 
    email="john.smith@example.com" 
    location={{city: "New York", region: "NY"}} 
    phone="555-555-5555"
  />
</div>

```jsx
<Heading 
  name="John Smith" 
  title="Architect" 
  email="john.smith@example.com" 
  location={{city: "New York", region: "NY"}} 
  phone="555-555-5555"
/>  
```

---

## End Structure

At this point, the building blocks exist to make a resume. The **resume-react** component library stays 
fairly unopinionated on styling. I opted for that approach to make adoption easier for users.

<div style={EXAMPLE_STYLE}>
  <Heading 
    name="John Smith" 
    title="Architect" 
    email="john.smith@example.com" 
    location={{city: "New York", region: "NY"}} 
    phone="555-555-5555"
  />
  <Content title="SUMMARY">
    <span> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. </span>
  </Content>
  <Content title="EXPERIENCE">
    <Work

## Closing Thoughts

Without diving into the [component definitions](https://github.com/Kevin-K/resume-react),
the componentry has been established to adhere to the JSONSchema. the **Heading**, **Work**, **Volunteer**, 
**Education**, and **Skills** accept properties matching the schema structure. For example, this snippet
shows how I put the components to use on my [resume](/resume):

```jsx
import resumeData from './sampleResume.json';

//...

<Heading {...resumeData.basics} />
<Content title="SUMMARY">
  <span> {resumeData.basics.summary}</span>
</Content>
<Content title="EXPERIENCE">
  {resumeData.work.map(entry => (
    <Work {...entry} key={`${entry.name}-${entry.startDate}`} />
  ))}
</Content>
<Content title="VOLUNTEER">
  {resumeData.volunteer.map(entry => (
    <Volunteer {...entry} key={`${entry.name}-${entry.startDate}`} />
  ))}
</Content>
<Content title="EDUCATION">
  {resumeData.education.map(entry => (
    <Education {...entry} key={`${entry.name}-${entry.startDate}`} />
  ))}
</Content>
<Content title="SKILLS">
  {resumeData.skills.map(entry => (
    <Skills {...entry} key={`${entry.name}-${entry.level}`} />
  ))}
</Content>

//...
```
