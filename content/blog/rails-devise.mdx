title: Rails and Devise
description: Adding authentication to a Rails 6 app
---

In preperation for a lunch and learn for our engineering staff at [Megaphone](https://www.megaphone.fm) on authentication & authorization,
I found myself wondering what setting up Devise looks like in Rails 6 (we've been running a Rails app that we've pushed to upgrade from 4 -> 6).
Devise has [great documentation](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise#getting-started) to get you going, you'll find steps to setup there, 
but I'm captain's logging my work here as well. Without further adiue, lets dive right in.


## Creating a new app

```bash
rails new sandbox
```

By default a rails app is _fairly_ thin, no authentication is provided off the back.

##### Gemfile
```rb
source 'https://rubygems.org'
git_source(:github) { |repo| "https://github.com/#{repo}.git" }

ruby '2.6.3'

# Bundle edge Rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails'
gem 'rails', '~> 6.0.2', '>= 6.0.2.2'
# Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record
gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4'
# Use Puma as the app server
gem 'puma', '~> 4.1'
# Use SCSS for stylesheets
gem 'sass-rails', '>= 6'
# Transpile app-like JavaScript. Read more: https://github.com/rails/webpacker
gem 'webpacker', '~> 4.0'
# Turbolinks makes navigating your web application faster. Read more: https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks
gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5'
# Build JSON APIs with ease. Read more: https://github.com/rails/jbuilder

# Use Redis adapter to run Action Cable in production
# gem 'redis', '~> 4.0'
# Use Active Model has_secure_password
# gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'

# Use Active Storage variant
# gem 'image_processing', '~> 1.2'

# Reduces boot times through caching; required in config/boot.rb
gem 'bootsnap', '>= 1.4.2', require: false

group :development, :test do
  # Call 'byebug' anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console
  gem 'byebug', platforms: [:mri, :mingw, :x64_mingw]
end

group :development do
  # Access an interactive console on exception pages or by calling 'console' anywhere in the code.
  gem 'web-console', '>= 3.3.0'
  gem 'listen', '>= 3.0.5', '< 3.2'
  # Spring speeds up development by keeping your application running in the background. Read more: https://github.com/rails/spring
  gem 'spring'
  gem 'spring-watcher-listen', '~> 2.0.0'
end

group :test do
  # Adds support for Capybara system testing and selenium driver
  gem 'capybara', '>= 2.15'
  gem 'selenium-webdriver'
  # Easy installation and use of web drivers to run system tests with browsers
  gem 'webdrivers'
end

# Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]
```

## Adding Devise

We'll need to add Devise since it doesn't ship with Rails.

##### Gemfile

```
gem 'devise'
```

Then we'll run a bundle install and the generator for devise additions.

```bash
bundle install
rails generate devise:install
```

With all that installed, Devise will waarn of a few things needing to be ensured

```
Running via Spring preloader in process 43860
      create  config/initializers/devise.rb
      create  config/locales/devise.en.yml
===============================================================================

Depending on your application's configuration some manual setup may be required:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

     * Required for all applications. *

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root to: "home#index"
     
     * Not required for API-only Applications *

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

     * Not required for API-only Applications *

  4. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g devise:views
       
     * Not required *

===============================================================================
```

### 1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files.

This one is asking us to place a default url for our action mailer for the development 
environment, adding the following suffices.

##### config/environments/development.rb

```rb
Rails.application.configure do
    # ... existing content
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
end
```

### 2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.

We haven't defined any routes in our app yet.

##### config/routes.rb

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end
```

Lets add a Home controller with an index.

```bash
rails generate Home index
```

Now we can satisfy that root_url

##### config/routes.rb

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'home/index'
  root :to => "home#index"
end
```


### 3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
We'll just add the example snippet above the yield.

```erb
    <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
    <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
```

###### views/layouts/application.html.erb

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Sandbox</title>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= csp_meta_tag %>

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
    <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
    <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>

```

### 4. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app
No action needed here, but good to know to break free of the default for own styling.
If you want to you can run the following.

```bash
rails g devise:views
```

## Adding Users

At this point the necessities to use Devise are aligned, but we don't have a model leveraging it.
A typical approach is to use the User model for authentication purposes. We don't have that model
yet, but devise can create it for us.

```bash
rails generate devise User
```

Now our user model has some devise modules added

##### app/models/user.rb

```rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable, :trackable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
end
```

## But I don't have to Log In?
At this point if you navigate to your app's root (remember we only have a Home controller),
you'll see it without logging in. Devise treats authentication as an opt-in action.

If you want to add authentication to only the Home controller's routes you can use the following.

##### app/controllers/home_controller.rb

```rb
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!
  def index
  end
end
```

If you are building an app where you want all routes to require authentication, you can lift the `before_action`
up to the ApplicationController (root controller which others inherit from).

##### app/controllers/application_controller

```rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :authenticate_user!
  def index
  end
end
```

For the purposes of this example I'm going with the latter (all routes get `authenticate_user!`).


## Voila!
You're app now has user authentication. Devise provides a lot of functionality out of the box. We don't see
the controller/views of devise because we didnt run the view generation (`rails g devise:views`) but
theres a handfull of things ready to go now. Before breaking down the modules included in the User model,
take a moment to play with the sign in, sign out, sign up, and  forgotten password functionality.

From here, lets break down what devise modules were added during the generation in the User model.

##### app/models/user.rb

```rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable, :trackable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
end
```


### database_authenticatable
> Authenticatable Module, responsible for hashing the password and
  validating the authenticity of a user while signing in.
  This module defines a `password=` method. This method will hash the argument
  and store it in the `encrypted_password` column, bypassing any pre-existing
  `password` column if it exists.

Password security is not a simple thing to self handle. Using Devise
out of the box is giving enough security to shield oneself from issue like 
"storing passwords in the clear" because the passwords are managed in an encrypted manner.
Here's an important thing to remember:

#### DON'T ROLL YOUR OWN CRYPTO

The security of an application is an ever-present battle. Technology advancements
lead to more secure encryption, and also leads to more feasible attacks on encryption.
Leveraging industry-backed encryption protocols is the smart way to go, and keeping
libraries providing those protocols up to date is the safe way to go. I won't
break down the aspects of password encryption in this post, rather point out what
is configurable. Hopefully this aids in a google search for further clarity.


Quoting the source documentation, the DatabaseAuthenticatable module gives 
us the `password=` functionality on our Users model, and handles the action of 
encrypting it within the database. Theres a few configurables that trickle into the
devise config file from this module, they are below.

##### config/initializers/devise.rb

```rb
Devise.setup do |config|
  # ...
  # ==> Configuration for :database_authenticatable
  # For bcrypt, this is the cost for hashing the password and defaults to 12. If
  # using other algorithms, it sets how many times you want the password to be hashed.
  # The number of stretches used for generating the hashed password are stored
  # with the hashed password. This allows you to change the stretches without
  # invalidating existing passwords.
  #
  # Limiting the stretches to just one in testing will increase the performance of
  # your test suite dramatically. However, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not use
  # a value less than 10 in other environments. Note that, for bcrypt (the default
  # algorithm), the cost increases exponentially with the number of stretches (e.g.
  # a value of 20 is already extremely slow: approx. 60 seconds for 1 calculation).
  config.stretches = Rails.env.test? ? 1 : 12
  
  
  # Set up a pepper to generate the hashed password.
  # config.pepper = 'b0bb61ca1eb5b207fe642f0beb39cbd0b8169db03ed535ac6921af2a29b5a1b4cae3147c05d954ddd07c6b976fb605488f92fdcb36de551090ddd0dd9eea820b'

  # Send a notification to the original email when the user's email is changed.
  # config.send_email_changed_notification = false

  # Send a notification email when the user's password is changed.
  # config.send_password_change_notification = false

end
```

#### stretches
This specifies the number of times the password is hashed, for protection against a brute-force
attack on a password the higher the number the better, but at a performance trade-off.

#### pepper
A string that is appended to the user's password to be passed to the salt generator as a step
of the password hash generation.

#### send_email_changed_notification/send_password_change_notification
Notification flags to email the user on an update to their account.


### registerable
> Registerable is responsible for everything related to registering a new
  resource (ie user sign up).

By including this module to the User model, the "Sign Up" functionality is added to the application.
The controller and view aspects of registration are only active if this module is included.
A good thing to have on hand for an application which does not allow users to enroll themselves.

For a practical example, remove `:registerable` from the devise call in the User model, and see
how the application reacts.

There is one configurable for this module.


##### config/initializers/devise.rb

```rb
Devise.setup do |config|
  # ...
  # ==> Configuration for :registerable

  # When set to false, does not sign a user in automatically after their password is
  # changed. Defaults to true, so a user is signed in automatically after changing a password.
  # config.sign_in_after_change_password = true
end
```

### recoverable
> Recoverable takes care of resetting the user password and send reset instructions.

This gives the "Forgot your password?" functionality to the application.
The configurables are below.

##### config/initializers/devise.rb

```rb
Devise.setup do |config|
  # ...
  # ==> Configuration for :recoverable
  #
  # Defines which key will be used when recovering the password for an account
  # config.reset_password_keys = [:email]

  # Time interval you can reset your password with a reset password key.
  # Don't put a too small interval or your users won't have the time to
  # change their passwords.
  config.reset_password_within = 6.hours

  # When set to false, does not sign a user in automatically after their password is
  # reset. Defaults to true, so a user is signed in automatically after a reset.
  # config.sign_in_after_reset_password = true
end
```

### rememberable
> Rememberable manages generating and clearing token for remembering the user
  from a saved cookie. Rememberable also has utility methods for dealing
  with serializing the user into the cookie and back from the cookie, trying
  to lookup the record based on the saved information.
  You probably wouldn't use rememberable methods directly, they are used
  mostly internally for handling the remember token.

This is the functionality that allows users to stay logged in on the given
device/browser for days/weeks/months/years
(please don't let them stay logged in that long). This is **cookie** based.


##### config/initializers/devise.rb

```rb
Devise.setup do |config|
  # ...
  # ==> Configuration for :rememberable
  # The time the user will be remembered without asking for credentials again.
  # config.remember_for = 2.weeks

  # Invalidates all the remember me tokens when the user signs out.
  config.expire_all_remember_me_on_sign_out = true

  # If true, extends the user's remember period when remembered via cookie.
  # config.extend_remember_period = false

  # Options to be passed to the created cookie. For instance, you can set
  # secure: true in order to force SSL only cookies.
  # config.rememberable_options = {}

end
```

### validatable
> Validatable creates all needed validations for a user email and password.
  It's optional, given you may want to create the validations by yourself.
  Automatically validate if the email is present, unique and its format is
  valid. Also tests presence of password, confirmation and length.

Adds configurable restrictions to the user's email and password.
This is where you want to go if you're changing your password length/strength
requirements.

```rb
Devise.setup do |config|
  # ...
  # ==> Configuration for :validatable
  # Range for password length.
  config.password_length = 6..128

  # Email regex used to validate email formats. It simply asserts that
  # one (and only one) @ exists in the given string. This is mainly
  # to give user feedback and not to assert the e-mail validity.
  config.email_regexp = /\A[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\z/
end
```

## What are the other Devise Modules?
Everything covered above is what was enabled on the User model by default when 
running the generation, but devise comes with extras! Lets look at them
from a high level, disregarding the configurables for now.

Take note: when adding a devise module migrations are necessary in some instances.
Take a look at the Devise wiki for needed steps, for example here is the needed 
migration for [confirmable](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Add-:confirmable-to-Users).

### omniauthable
Adds [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) support. This allows users
to login using their identy with "everything from Facebook to LDAP".

### confirmable
> Confirmable is responsible to verify if an account is already confirmed to
  sign in, and to send emails with confirmation instructions.
  Confirmation instructions are sent to the user email after creating a
  record and when manually requested by a new confirmation instruction request.

This makes the user confirm their email on registration. This ensures users don't
sign up with a typo/invalid email address. The user's account isn't activated
until confirmed (but this is configurable).

### trackable
> Track information about your user sign in.

Tracks each user's sign in count, time of current sign in and last sign out, and
current/last IP address.

### timeoutable
> Timeoutable takes care of verifying whether a user session has already
  expired or not. When a session expires after the configured time, the user
  will be asked for credentials again, it means, they will be redirected
  to the sign in page.

Sounds similar to rememberable? Rememberable operates on a **cookie based** token
system to authenticate the user's actions. The clock does not reset when the user
performs an action, rather they are **asked to relogin** on a periodic basis.

Timeoutable is a **session based** authentication check. This module adds tracking of
`last_request_at` in the session for the user, should the user not perform
some action after N amount of time their session is terminated.

This is useful for more sensitive-data focused applications. Take a banking app
for example, you wouldn't want your bank to keep you logged in for a few minutes
at a time, rather you would want your bank to forcibly log you out after a few 
minutes of inactivity. 


### lockable
> Handles blocking a user access after a certain number of attempts.
  Lockable accepts two different strategies to unlock a user after it's
  blocked: email and time. The former will send an email to the user when
  the lock happens, containing a link to unlock its account. The second
  will unlock the user automatically after some configured time (ie 2.hours).
  It's also possible to set up lockable to use both email and time strategies.

Break out those password managers, or prepare to reset your password or wait
when you forget your password and inevitably try dozens of different combinations
or the same password over and over and over again!

This module adds restrictions to failed password attempts.


## Where to go from Here?
Everything covered up to this point is devise-provided functionality through the gem.
There's an entire ecosystem of addon gems out there, go 
[check them out](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=devise) and see what
cool features are out there.
