What is MDX? Its Markdown + JSX.
I haven't taken the time to learn the powers of that extra **X**,
and what better way than with rambling out my discoveries as a blog post.

## Background

I've been using markdown as long as I've used git,
most commonly writing up the everpresent `README.md` document, but also in
documentation for libraries.

For a project I contributed to back in 2016 we needed
some form of interactive documentation for our github page content, allowing
developers to see live results of JavaScript running along side the docs.

At the time, we leveraged [codepen](codepen.io) iframes to embed running code
within our docs, it gave us interaction and the bonus of having sandbox-able code
in front of users. The documents don't appear to have stood up to the test of time,
the codepens haven't been kept up and runnable, but here's a
[reference of where I am coming from](https://ozoneplatform.github.io/ozp-iwc/1.2.2/tutorial/02_dataApi.html).

## Diving in

This blog, at the time of writing, is running on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). The
documentation [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/) will help getting your
Gatsby site up and running with MDX.

Everything you've read up to this sentence has been good old markdown. It's time
to leap into the beyond!

#### Here's a Slider (material-ui)

import Slider from '@material-ui/core/Slider';

<Slider />

Cool that was a slider, but wait, this is a markdown document, how did I get a
react component in here? MDX lets you mix in JSX valid syntax within your
markdown content. Here's what was coded behind the scene to bring you
that sweet slider:

```jsx
import Slider from '@material-ui/core/Slider';

<Slider />
```

MDX supports the [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/doc/plugins.md)
plugin ecosystem, I actually paused mid-writing this post to add the
[gatsby-remark-prismjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs/)
plugin to my gatsby site so I could start putting
code snippets and interaction in my posts.

## Other things to note
Since we can import JSX components, we can add use JSX inline as well:

<div style={{display: 'flex'}}>
  <span style={{ flex:1, color: 'red' }}>TEST</span>
  <span style={{ flex:1,  fontSize: 8 }}>TEST</span>
  <span style={{ flex:1,  fontSize: 4 }}>TEST</span>
</div>

Here's the snippet I dropped in MDX to create the above example:
```jsx
<div style={{display: 'flex'}}>
  <span style={{ flex:1, color: 'red' }}>TEST</span>
  <span style={{ flex:1,  fontSize: 8 }}>TEST</span>
  <span style={{ flex:1,  fontSize: 4 }}>TEST</span>
</div>
```

It looks like this pairing of markdown and JSX will help suit my needs.
I'm not sure it solves all web-content struggles, but I now have a 
better idea of how I can compose technical blog posts with examples in
a collocated manner.
